# countingSortAlgorithm

The algorithm with complexity O(n^2) is a trivial one
with calls for pointers pointing in two ends of an array
of characters, a string, the print is in main due to 
the fact that for the loop control, which we don't get
our time on it, we just specify directly using size.
We use two intervals for comparing each start end positions
and end-1 and start-1 positions, and if we don't have
yet a completely sorting, it's evidente that we have
structures to get this done.

P.S.: the numbers in code talk by themselves.
